# ludo

This is a simple implementation of the Ludo game in Python. The game allows multiple players to take turns rolling the dice and moving their pieces on the board until one player wins.

## Rules of the Game

1. The game is played on a square board divided into multiple colored squares, with each color representing a player.
2. Each player has four pieces of the same color.
3. Players take turns rolling a six-sided dice.
4. If a player rolls a 6, they can move one of their pieces onto the starting square.
5. After getting a piece onto the starting square, players move their pieces forward the number of steps indicated by the dice roll.
6. Players can only move their own pieces.
7. Pieces can't pass or land on squares already occupied by another piece of the same color.
8. If a piece lands on a square already occupied by an opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is sent back to the starting square.
9. The first player to move all four of their pieces to the destination square wins the game.

## How to Run the Game

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Copy the code from the provided example into a Python file (e.g., `ludo.py`).
3. Save the file.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the Python file is saved.
5. Run the Python file using the following command: `python ludo.py`.
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
7. When a player wins, the game will end, and the winning player will be displayed.
